# Unreal_Engine_4_Part02

Localized place to showcase all new features learned and implemented in Unreal Engine 4

lOCK AND LOAD:
  - Implemented a new ammo type that allows to grab physic bodies
  - Functionality to switch back to the regular damage dealing ammo while object stays where it was left placed
  - Player can also switch back to the Grab ammo and drop the object if so desired

METAHUMAN:
“You cannot be human without the ability to make symbols and recognize what they mean. A red stop sign is a symbol that tells cars to halt at an intersection. Red has zero connection to stop until human beings assign it that meaning.” ― Deepak Chopra, Metahuman: Unleashing Your Infinite Potential
  - Converted from first person to third person to test the power of MetaHuman tool
  - Implemented a small set of animations meant for prototyping
  - Things to try next: 
    - Make simple edits or full animations using UE4's control rig with a MetaHuman skeleton

METAHUMAN + ADVANCE LOCOMOTION SYSTEM:
  - Combined the Metahuman with the ALS to develop a high quality character
  - Added in my anti-gravity ammo and damage ammo to show case the character
  - No .gif because the show case file is too big, instead find it on imugur: https://imgur.com/a/P2IVjTp

GIVING LIFE TO THE LAND:
  - Learned about techniques and tools in order to generate foilage and assets throughout the world
  - Learned techniques in order to blend terrain textures better and generate terrain textures based off of parameters.
